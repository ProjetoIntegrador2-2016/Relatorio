 	Based on the difficulties that a wheelchair user face on transporting groceries in a supermarket, this project has as its main objective the production of an autonomous cart that follows the user during the path taken inside the market. Therefore, the project intends to increase the accessibility without the necessity of a companion, physical effort or shifting to another vehicle. Thus, a prototype of the cart will be developed, joining different engineerings, through calculations, preliminary analysis and dimensioning. Finally, in order to meet the necessities of the wheelchair users, this project proposes to build a practical, safe and cheap autonomous cart.
